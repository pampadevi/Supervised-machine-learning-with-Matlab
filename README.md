# Supervised-machine-learning-with-Matlab
In this respiratory I am using Matlab for regression model(univariate and multivariate). This respiratory is meant to test the knowledge of the algorithm that "goes under the hood" for built in libraries used elsewhere. This Matlab code will give me more control to manipulate data.  I have learned this knowlwdge from Machine learning course offered by Stanford.
